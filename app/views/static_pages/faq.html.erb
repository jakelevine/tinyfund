<p class="question">What is the purpose of TinyFund?</p> 
<p>TinyFund is a sustainable vehicle for uncomfortably early investing.</p>

<p class="question">Yea, but what is TinyFund?</p> 
<p>TinyFund is a VC fund that invests $25,000 into small technology companies.</p>

<p class="question">Where's the money, Lebowski?</p> 
<p>We raised $1,000,000 from 50 NYC-area Founders.</p>

<p class="question">Why isn't this like every other Venture Capital Fund?</p> 
<p>We're going to reinvest 50% of the fund profits back into the fund. The hope is that we never run out of capital, and we can keep investing forever.

<p>We'll only ever raise one fund, and it never ends, which means no artificial pressure on founders to return capital to us within some arbitrary period of time.</p>

<p class="question">Do you take a management fee?</p> 
<p>No, this is a side project. We're all involved in or running early stage technology companies.</p>
